The java-lambda-json-data project, created with [`aws-serverless-java-container`](https://github.com/aws/serverless-java-container).

The project folder also includes a `template.yml` file. You can use this [SAM](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model) file to deploy the project to AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway or test in local with the [SAM CLI](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sam-cli).

The file `application.yaml` located in path `/src/main/resources/` includes the REST call routes for the backend service to allow calls from the API Gateway.
